#  Air Quality in the Cloud
  Flask-powered web application that displayed air quality data sourced from the Open AQ API.


## Introduction
In this project, I developed a Flask web application to showcase air quality data. I utilized Flask, Flask-SQLAlchemy, and requests to build the application and interact with the Open AQ API.

## Part 1 - Flask in a File
I set up a basic Flask web application in a single file named aq_dashboard.py. I tested the application to ensure it ran successfully.

## Part 2 - Breathe Easy with OpenAQ
I explored the Open AQ API by pulling air quality data using the provided openaq.py module. I incorporated API requests into the Flask application to retrieve and display air quality data.

## Part 3 - That Data Belongs In A Database!
I integrated Flask-SQLAlchemy to store air quality data in a SQLite database. I created a data model for storing air quality records and implemented database operations within the Flask application.

## Part 4 - Dashboard to the Finish
I enhanced the application by querying the database for air quality records and filtering data based on specific criteria. I displayed relevant air quality information on the web dashboard.

## Part 5 - Turn it in!
I submitted the aq_dashboard.py file. I also included a screenshot of the running application in a web browser for grading and feedback.
